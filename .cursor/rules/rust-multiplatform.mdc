When working on rust-multiplatform apps like this, ALWAYS use the redux pattern for state: 
- frontend sends an event to rust
- rust processes it
- rust updates state by writing to sqlite and sending a notification of the update to the frontend
- frontend reads state from SQLite. 
- UI reactively re-renders based on new state

Always use this pattern. State is only ever updated in one direction. Never use bi-directional state.


If you ever want to re-generate the uniffi code for swift, run `just build-ios`. If you want to re-generate the uniffi code for kotlin run `just build-android`.
